## Intro

Cross-compiling Wireshark for Android allows developers to analyze network traffic directly on Android devices. By
having Wireshark available on Android, it becomes easier to troubleshoot network issues, debug mobile applications, and
perform security testing on mobile networks. This capability enhances the ability to analyze and understand network
behavior in a mobile context.

### Quickstart

To get started, download this repository and place the Vagrantfile in your development path, such as `/path/to/dev`.
Then, execute the command `vagrant up` to install the virtual image.

```
cd /path/to/dev
vagrant up
```

This command will compile Wireshark and its related libraries.

The virtual machine generates two folders: `ws_lib` and `ws_bin`. `ws_lib` contains `libwireshark.so` and other related
libraries, while `ws_bin` contains the binary programs `android_ws_dissector` and `android_ws_dissector_pie`.

To stop the virtual machine, you can use either of the following commands:

```
vagrant suspend (suspends the machine)
```

This repo contains a Vagrant environment that enables the automatic cross-compilation of Wireshark 3.4.0 for Android.
