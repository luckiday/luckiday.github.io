ü§ù Our team, [AnySign](https://anysign.net), is proud to be the accessibility sponsor
for [CPS-IoT Week 2024](https://cps-iot-week2024.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) in Hong Kong, offering ASL
interpretation. We‚Äôre thrilled to have supported the first sign language presentation at CPS-IoT Week. Additionally, we
presented our work on Sensor+AR at the [FMSys](https://fmsys24.github.io/).
