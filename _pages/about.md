I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from UCLA, mentored by [Prof. Songwu Lu](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~slu/). I also received my M.S. from UCLA in 2018. Prior to that, I earned a B.S. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2016, under the guidance of [Prof. Xinbing Wang](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/).

Focused on AR/mobile systems and visual language interaction, my research is particularly centered around crafting assistive AR for daily life. I'm passionately dedicated to creating technology that uplifts and augments individual experiences.

I am a member of the UCLA HandsOn Club and am currently studying American Sign Language (ASL). I also appreciate geometric abstraction art. Outside of academia, I enjoy off-roading and motorcycling.
