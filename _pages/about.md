I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at CUHK, working with [Prof. Guoliang Xing](https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~glxing/)
in the innovative [CUHK AIoT Lab](https://aiot.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/). My research, focusing on AR/mobile systems and visual
language interaction, is primarily aimed at developing assistive AR for daily life. I am deeply committed to creating
technology that enhances life experiences.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from UCLA under the mentorship
of [Prof. Songwu Lu](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~slu/). I also obtained my M.S. from UCLA in 2018. Prior to that, I
received a B.S. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2016, guided
by [Prof. Xinbing Wang](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/).

*Fun facts about meâ€¦* I am actively exploring the intersection of technology and accessibility, having visited more than
10 organizations and groups that promote societal accessibility. I have a passion for modern art and photography, and I
use some fantastic shots from my collection, YunqiGuo's Gallery, as my wallpapers. Finally, I enjoy off-roading and
motorcycling.
